# 🚀 **React Native Challenge Concepts**

##  ❓ About the React Native Challenge

This is a challenge to show some basic and fundamental concepts of React Native like specific tags of the library, for example: 

- SafeAreaView, View, FlatList, Text, StatusBar, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity 

- We learn a little bit about how to connect our backend with the frontend with **axios** package


## 🤓 Application Funcionalities

We created this simple application of the challenge to understand a basic concept of backend and frontend, where the user of our application should be able to like a repository of the API and our apllication should be able to list these created repositories. 

#### A simple example of the code challenge:
